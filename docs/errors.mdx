# Exception Hierarchy

The ARIS SDK uses a structured exception hierarchy to help you handle errors gracefully.

All exceptions inherit from the base `ArisError`.

```python
class ArisError(Exception):
    """Base exception for all Aris SDK errors."""
```

## Common Errors

### `ArisAuthenticationError`
Raised when the API key is missing, invalid, or expired.

```python
try:
    client = Aris(api_key="invalid-key")
    client.generate("fail")
except ArisAuthenticationError:
    print("Please check your API key.")
```

### `ArisPaymentError`
Raised during the **Handshake** phase if the account has insufficient credits.

```python
class ArisPaymentError(ArisError):
    """Raised when payment fails or balance is insufficient."""
```

### `ArisNodeError`
Raised when a worker node fails to respond or returns an error during inference. This can happen if a node goes offline mid-request.

```python
class ArisNodeError(ArisError):
    """Raised when the worker node fails to respond."""
```

## Handling Strategy

We recommend wrapping your generation calls in a try/except block to handle network and payment issues distinctively.

```python
from aris.client import Aris, ArisPaymentError, ArisNodeError

client = Aris()

try:
    response = client.generate("Hello world")
except ArisPaymentError:
    print("Billing issue - check balance.")
except ArisNodeError:
    print("Node failure - retrying automatically...")
    # Add your retry logic here
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```
