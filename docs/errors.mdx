## Exception hierarchy

All SDK errors inherit from `ArisError`.

```python
class ArisError(Exception):
    """Base exception for ARIS SDK errors."""
```

## Common exceptions

| Exception | Meaning | Retry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ArisAuthenticationError` | Invalid or missing API key. | No |
| `ArisPaymentError` | Insufficient credits or billing rejection. | No |
| `ArisNodeError` | Node timeout, disconnect, or execution failure. | Yes |
| `ArisRateLimitError` | Request rate exceeded. | Yes |

## HTTP status mapping

| Status | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `400` | Invalid request payload. | Fix request fields and retry. |
| `401` | Authentication failed. | Rotate or correct API key. |
| `402` | Credits required. | Increase balance and retry. |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded. | Backoff and retry with jitter. |
| `503` | No healthy nodes available. | Retry after short delay. |

## Recommended pattern

```python
from aris.client import Aris
from aris.errors import (
    ArisAuthenticationError,
    ArisPaymentError,
    ArisNodeError,
    ArisRateLimitError,
)

client = Aris(api_key="sk-aris-your-key")

try:
    response = client.generate(prompt="Generate a status summary")
except (ArisNodeError, ArisRateLimitError) as err:
    print(f"Temporary issue: {err}")
except ArisPaymentError:
    print("Insufficient credits.")
except ArisAuthenticationError:
    print("Invalid API key.")
```

  Do not retry malformed prompts (`400`) or invalid credentials (`401`) without changing the request.
